  abstract = {This paper presents the formal verification of a compiler front-end
that translates a subset of the C language into the Cminor
intermediate language.  The semantics of the source and target
languages as well as the translation between them have been written in
the specification language of the Coq proof assistant. The proof of
observational semantic equivalence between the source and generated
code has been machine-checked using Coq.  An executable compiler was
obtained by automatic extraction of executable Caml code from the Coq
specification of the translator, combined with a certified compiler
back-end generating PowerPC assembly code from Cminor, described in
previous work.},

abstract = {
Functional logic programming languages combine the most important
declarative programming paradigms, and attempts to combine these
paradigms have a long history.  The declarative multi-paradigm
language Curry is influenced by recent advances in the
foundations and implementation of functional logic languages.
The development of Curry is an international initiative intended
to provide a common platform for the research, teaching, and
application of integrated functional logic languages. This paper
surveys the foundations of functional logic programming that are
relevant for Curry, the main features of Curry, and extensions
and applications of Curry and functional logic programming.
